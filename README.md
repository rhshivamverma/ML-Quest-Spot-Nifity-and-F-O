# Regime-Based Quantitative Trading Strategy on NIFTY

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end **quantitative trading system** on **NIFTY 50** using **5-minute data**.  
It combines **technical indicators**, **options-derived features**, and **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** to detect market regimes and execute a **regime-filtered EMA trading strategy**.

The project demonstrates:
- Data engineering & feature engineering
- Regime detection using HMM
- Algorithmic trading strategy design
- Backtesting and performance evaluation

---

## Objective
To improve trading performance by:
- Identifying market regimes (Uptrend, Downtrend, Sideways)
- Filtering EMA crossover signals using regime information
- Evaluating strategy performance using risk-adjusted metrics
